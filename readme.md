# Pizza Builder

## Problem Statement
There have been many times where I was with a group and we wanted to order a pizza but could not decide
what kind to get. I used to work at a pizza place and whenever we were trying to decide what to
eat for dinner there were always people saying that they don't like certain toppings or that we
always have the same thing. I thought it would be a cool idea to build an application that would
generate a pizza that everyone will like.

This app is will allow users to create an account that will store their favorite pizza toppings.
They can then join groups with their friends, family, or coworkers and whenever that group wants
to order a pizza the app will generate a pizza based on the toppings they all enjoy. The users
will also be able to adjust the amount of toppings and if they want topping that are common or not
to mix up what kind of pizza they get.

## User Stories
- I want to be able to create an account so that I don't have to keep reentering the topping I like
- I want to be able to quickly and easily create a pizza that everyone in the house will like
- I want to be able to add people to a group so that I don't have to select all my friends every time we order
- I want to be able to change the amount of toppings on the pizza to keep the price down
- I want to be able to sort which toppings go on the pizza by how popular they are so that we can try something new
