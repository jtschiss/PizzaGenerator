# Pizza Builder

## Problem Statement
This app is will allow users to create an account that will store their favorite pizza toppings.
They can then join groups with their friends, family, or coworkers and whenever that group wants
to order a pizza the app will generate a pizza based on the toppings they all enjoy.

## User Stories
- I want to be able to create an account so that I don't have to keep reentering the topping I like
- I want to be able to quickly and easily create a pizza that everyone in the house will like
- I want to be able to add people to a group so that I don't have to select all my friends every time we order
- I want to be able to change the amount of toppings on the pizza to keep the price down
- I want to be able to sort which toppings go on the pizza by how popular they are so that we can try something new
